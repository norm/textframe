The textframe file format


    Basic structural information
    
    
        End of line characters
        
        End of line characters in a textframe document can be DOS (line
        feed and carriage returns), Unix (line feed only) or Mac OS Classic
        (carriage return only) style. Generated textframe documents will be
        output with Unix linefeeds only.
    
        
        White space
    
        White space in blocks of content is recognised to be spaces, tabs
        and end of line characters. Other white space is treated as 
        content.
    
        
        Line length
    
        There is no defined limit on line lengths for textframe input. 
        Generated documents will be wrapped at 78 characters.
    
        
        Blocks
        
        Blocks of content are high-level structural objects, such as
        paragraphs, lists and headers. They are separated by a minimum of
        one blank line (although it can contain white space). Multiple 
        blank lines can be used for visual separation in the source document
        but this does not influence the document structure, except in the 
        case of hinting headings (see below).
    
        
        Indentation
        
        Indentation is measured in virtual tab stops which are four 
        characters across.
        
        
    Types of block content
    
    
        Paragraph
        
        Paragraphs are the basic building block of any lightweight markup
        language, as well as most of the content that textframe is ideally
        suited to managing.
        
        Any block which has no structural markers is treated as a paragraph.
        Paragraphs must be indented by a minimum of two stops (ie. by
        eight spaces).
        
        
        Heading
        
        Headings are indicated by short text on a line by itself. Indentation
        controls the level of heading, so:
        
    1.  a first level of heading is flush to the left of the document
    
    2.  a second level heading is one stop in, at four spaces
    
    3.  a third level heading is two stops in (and so on...)
        
        It is possible for the parser to confuse short paragraphs with 
        headings. Therefore the following hints are built into the parser
        to enable auto-detection of headers:
        
    *   if the header is a single line and it does not end in any common 
        end-of-sentence punctuation
        
    *   if the header is followed by multiple dashes (-) to form a ruled line
    
    *   if the header was preceded by multiple blank lines as separators
    
    *   if the first and last characters in the block are matching dashes
        (-) or equals (=) symbols
        
        
        Bulleted lists
        
        Bulleted lists are indicated by prefixing each list item with a
        symbol followed by an indent. First-level lists have their symbols
        at the first stop, so the bullets are hanging.
        
    >   From [Mark Boulton's Five Simple Steps]:
    >   With hanging punctuation the flow of text on the left hand side is
    >   uninterrupted. The bullets, glyphs or numbers sit in the gutter to
    >   highlight the list. This representation of a list is more sophisticated
    >   visually and more legible.
        
        The bullet symbol is one of:
        
    *   an asterisk (*)
    
    *   a lowercase letter O (o)
    
    *   a period (.)
    
    *   a hyphen (-)
    
        The symbol used does not affect the document in any way. Generated
        textframe documents will always use an asterisk.
        
        
        Numbered lists
        
        Numbered lists are indicated the same as bulleted lists, except that
        the symbol is either:
        
    *   a number followed by a period (.) to declare the number of that item
    
    *   a hash symbol (#) to have the number automatically incremented
    
        If the first item is a #, it is treated as 1. A list where the first
        item is a number that is not 1 will inform the parser that the list
        starts at that number and not at 1. All other numbers in the list are
        ignored (treated identically to #).


        Extended quotations
        
        A quotation which covers one or more blocks of content is indicated 
        by prefixing the blocks with a greater-than symbol (>) one indent
        back, like list markers.
        
/*      TODO:
 *      Need to explain how citations work for block comments.
 */
    
        
        Comments
        
        Comments are included in the document in two ways.
        
        
            Ignored comments
            
        Ignored comments are text in the source document that should not
        be parsed and used to output other formats. This could conceivably 
        include document metadata, prose that is still in draft, notes to 
        the author, et cetera. Ignored comment blocks are started with
        the marker slash-star (/*) and end with star-slash (*/). 
        
        The start marker cannot be indented at all, and the end marker can be
        indented by one optional space. This is so that any ActionScript, C,
        CSS, JavaScript, PHP etc. comments included in the text are not
        accidentally parsed as textframe comments.
        
        
            Included comments
        
        An included comment is some text that should by preserved in the 
        textframe output, either as another included comment or in HTML
        by surrounding it with <!-- and --> markers. Included comments are
        blocks of text which are prefixed with a hash symbol (#) one indent 
        back, like list markers.
        
        
        Code blocks
        
/*      TODO:
 *      Decide how to differentiate a pre-formatted code block from a 
 *      normal paragraph, and how to indicate the language it is in.
 */
