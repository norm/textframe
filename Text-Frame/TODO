    *   Finish writing the tests.

    *   Write tests for the internal functions of Frame.pm, as well as
        the actual textframe documents.
    
    *   Provide a push-back mechanism so that a block can add new 
        blocks to the tree; this would allow individual list items to be 
        nestled rather than separated by blank lines
    
    *   Allow the $frame object to be re-used, and plugins to reset their
        state (eg. %links used in Link.pm).
        
    *   Implement a neater formatting option (especially for lengthy 
        reference links).

    *   Check for "magic numbers".

    *   Use caller() in get/set_metadata routine to autoset the category,
        unless specified (to allow Blockquote to get at Link metadata).
    
    *   Other HTML possibilities to explore:
        *   abbr
        *   dfn, samp, kbd, var
        *   cite
        *   sub, sup
        *   br
        *   definition lists
        *   images
        *   horizontal rules
        *   tables
    
    *   Refactor the HTML list output routines to be more comprehensible.
    
    *   Indented text after a list item is a continuation of the previous
        list item.
    
    *   Use the current data structure for metadata, rather than a separate
        one accessed via functions?
